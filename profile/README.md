The world's first Esports simulator for Counter-Strike where you can play your matches in-game or simulate them, you choose!

# Features

- All major versions of Counter-Strike are supported.
- The app launches Counter-Strike and connects you to a local server.
- Then it adds the teams and players to the server as bots with their customized names and stats, according to how they exist within the app.
- You can train your team to gain an edge over your opponents. The app will automatically adjust the bot difficulty to reflect these stat changes.
- Finally, once in-game, you type `.ready` in chat and the match will start. Once there is a winner, the app will record your results.
- As you win matches you can rise through the divisions in your league (open, intermediate, main, advanced, invite).
- Minors and Major competitions supported. But you'll have to qualify for these, of course!
